We see a future where India's roads hum with clean energy, where our cities breathe easier, and where sustainable transportation empowers everyone. We focus on what matters most to India: the iconic auto-rickshaw and their drivers. These versatile vehicles are the lifeblood of our communities. But the reliance on fossil fuels can't continue. That's why we created the innovative RetroKitÂ®. In just two short hours, we can transform your existing gasoline or diesel auto-rickshaw into a clean, electric machine. It's a win-win! You save money on fuel, reduce your environmental impact, and contribute to a healthier future for all.
            Whether you're a driver seeking a cleaner ride, a business owner looking for a sustainable solution, or a talented individual who shares our vision, Electromotion has a place for you.
